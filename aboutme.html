<p><b><center><h1>About Me</h1></center></b></p>
	
<p style="text-align: center">My name is Conor Cronin, I am from Fairfield, Connecticut, and have lived their my entire life. I have two younger sister who I am very close with. Some things I like to do for fun are playing sports, skiing, snowboarding, hanging out with my friends, and going to sporting events. I love dogs and intend on purchasing one right when I get out of college, if before then. i've had three dogs in my life time. Right now I have a yellow lab named hudson. Sports have been one of the biggest aspects of my life so far. The skills that I have learned from playing sports these past 16+ years have been so influential on the person that I have grown to be. Baseball has always been my favorite sport, but I also played basketball and football. Baseball was my first love and likely always will be. My grandfather played basketball, baseball, and golf in college and has always taught my the value of playing multiple sports and not just focusing on one. He's been a person that I've looked up to my entire life.  </center></p>
