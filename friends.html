<p style="text-align: center"> Being from a large town, and through AAU sports. When I was very young, the majority of my friends I met through sports. I've had a group of friends that went to a different highschool than me because of our connections in sports. That being said, some of my best friends for life were met at Fairfield Ludlowe high school, where I went to school. My friends and I love attending sporting events and going to the movies. I am currently going to college with three friends from my home town. We've met many other kids at our time at Umaine and have been having a great time, even though we are six hours from home. I am looking forward to seeing all of my friends again when I return to Fairfield, Connecticut over Thanksgiving break. </center></p>
