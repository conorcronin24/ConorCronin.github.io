<hr>
<p> My major is Business Undeclared and I chose it because even though I am interested in the business field, I would still like to keep my options open for my future endevors. I think that the business field is really amazing in the way that you are able to pursue so many different careers and develope many different ways of thinking. What peaked my interest in business was the influence of my parents and other family members. My father is a marketing professor at Marist College, my mother works at the head of the marketing department at Time inc, a magazine company that includes Sports Illustrated, Time Magazine, and People Magazine. The majority of my uncles work in the business field as well, and so do many of my aunts and cousins.  </p>
<p> I am excited to get more in depth with the IT side of things considering when someone of a younger age is searching for a job it is common that the interviewer of boss will expect them to have a greater understanding of the latest technology. I believe this class will help me to gain that adavantage </p>. Some of the sport I have played competively and have tried for fun include basketball, baseball, rugby, hockey. </center></p>
