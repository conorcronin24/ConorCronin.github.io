<p>

style="text-align: center">I am the oldest child in my family. I live with my father, mother, and two younger sisters. We have a yellow lab puppy named hudson who is also a big member of our family. I have over 30 first cousins and I am very close with all of them. Each summer I get together with each side of my family for reunions. I see the majority of my cousins on a fairly regular basis. My cousins live all over the country, and even across the Atlantic Ocean. I have cousins and family in Connecticut, Maine, New York, Massachussets, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey and even in London, England. Whenever I get together with my family, our days usually consist of swimming, playing wiffle ball, and listening to all of the ridiculous stories my Dad and his 3 brothers tell me and my cousins. I have a very unique family and always look forward to seeing them.  </center>
