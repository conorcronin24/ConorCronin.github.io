<p><b><><h1>Sports</h1></center></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center"> I played three different year round sports throughout high school. I played football, basketball, and baseball. Baseball always had been my favorite sport, and even today still is even though I am no longer playing it. I have met countless life long friends playing baseball, have had several great influential coaches, and it has taught my many life skills such as how to work with a team and how to handle failure. I am also big New York sports fan, and always have been my whole life. The Yankees were my very first obsession, and even watching the games today is one of my favorite parts of every day. I also am a fan of the Knicks, Jets, and Rangers. I love watching college sports. I am a UCONN basketball fan, as well as a Nebraska football fan.   </center></p>
